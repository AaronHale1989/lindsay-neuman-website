                <p>Lindsay Neuman loves to help people pivot. But what is a pivot anyway?  Other than a great dance move, it’s a way to change your perspective and change your outcome. Lindsay leads her life according to this guiding principle.  That is what makes her perfect to ‘make it happen’ for you.  Her zest for life is contagious and she loves to help people find their happy place.  Like, literally, find their happy place!
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                Your home is not just bricks and mortar, your home is your community and extension of yourself, your personality, wants, needs and desires.  It lives beyond your front door and reaches out into the community, the restaurants, the culture, the sights and sounds, the parks, and even dog parks.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                For years, Lindsay worked in public relations, recognized for making products and communications POP; making them multi-dimensional, and come to life.  That is why her pivot into Real Estate has been so gratifying to her and the clients she serves (see all the love notes on her Compass site).  She serves all and aids people in every stage of life to make it happen – to pivot and have fun along the way.

                    <br/>
                When Lindsay isn’t bopping around the city guiding her clients to their dream homes, she loves to spend time with her husband, Eli, their two dogs, Miley and Dora as well as her family. She refuels herself through a mix of Peloton spinning classes and a yoga practice. She lives to eat (not eats to live) and if you are ever undecided with a place to go for brunch, lunch or dinner, she is sure to have ALL the recommendations. 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                Life is crazy, unpredictable and exciting!  It is the best ride ever!  So, make your pivots reflect the life you want to live - Lindsay is here to help you make it happen!
